Next steps:
* add an overview page for orchestration so I can see
  - how many have completed problems and the average rating
  - how many reviews have been written
  - what answers have been submitted and how they have been reviewed
* allow students to see all of their work (e.g. reviews)
* remove all ES6 code (const, let and =>)
* switch to meteor methods
* add publications (so you only download code from your class or classes)
* add schema checking/validation to meteor methods
* get other faculty to use it...
* experiment with calibrated peer review
* write a paper on it
