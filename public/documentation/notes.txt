Next Steps:
* allow students to see other reviews as they make their own review
* allow students to edit their reviews
* add the average score to each answer
  we may need three fields, totalPoints,numReviews,avgReview
  which are updated each time we add a review
  This will allow us to sort by average score
* have the navigations buttons appear on all pages (see reviews, etc.)
* switch to meteor methods
* add publications (so you only download code from your class or classes)
* add schema checking/validation to meteor methods
* get other faculty to use it...
* experiment with calibrated peer review
* write a paper on it

Completed Steps
* 9/25 allow students to see all of their work (e.g. reviews)
* 9/24 fixed a bug showing your answer to a question (but it showed a random answer)
* 9/24 add an overview page for orchestration so I can see
  - how many have completed problems and the average rating
  - how many reviews have been written
  - what answers have been submitted and how they have been reviewed
* remove all ES6 code (const, let and =>)
