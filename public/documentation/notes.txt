This is for quick ideas, but everything has been moved to zenhub

Next Steps:
* I'm going to store summary information about each student in a class
  in their StudentInfo document, and have a meteor method that can
  update this. This will allow me to sort and filter students to see
  who is doing well and who needs help...


Completed Steps
* 9/20 v1.1  created better summary page ...
* 9/27 after filtering out students with more than minimal reviews,
  make a random selection from the rest, this will better balance the reviews
* 9/26 allow students to see other reviews as they make their own review
* 9/25 allow students to see all of their work (e.g. reviews)
* 9/24 fixed a bug showing your answer to a question (but it showed a random answer)
* 9/24 add an overview page for orchestration so I can see
  - how many have completed problems and the average rating
  - how many reviews have been written
  - what answers have been submitted and how they have been reviewed
* remove all ES6 code (const, let and =>)
