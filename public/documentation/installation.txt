Installation Guide

Scaling
This uses the meteorhacks:cluster package
so when we start it up you need to specify the number of cores to use:

% meteor add meteorhacks:cluster
% export CLUSTER_WORKERS_COUNT=2
 or
% export CLUSTER_WORKERS_COUNT=auto
and test with
% echo $CLUSTER_WORKERS_COUNT


Also, remember to turn off the password login
% meteor remove accounts-password

and to make sure that the client/startup.js file correctly specifies gracehopper
(though I don't know if that is really needed....)

Start it, in the bash shell, as follows:

% ROOT_URL="http://gracehopper.cs-i.brandeis.edu:3500" meteor run --port 3500
